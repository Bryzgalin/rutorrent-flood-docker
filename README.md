## Description

This is a completely funcional Docker image with flood, rutorrent, rtorrent, libtorrent and a lot of plugins
for rutorrent, like autodl-irssi, filemanager, fileshare and other useful ones.

Based on Alpine Linux, which provides a very small size.

Includes plugins: logoff fileshare filemanager pausewebui mobile ratiocolor force_save_session showip ...

Also installed and selected by default this awesome theme: club-QuickBox

Also includes MaterialDesign theme as an option.

You need to run pyrocore commands with user "abc", which is who runs rtorrent, so use "su - abc" after connecting container before using pyrocore commands. If you already have torrents in your rtorrent docker instance, you have to add extra information before using pyrocore, check here: http://pyrocore.readthedocs.io/en/latest/setup.html in the "Adding Missing Data to Your rTorrent Session" topic.

rTelegram is added, that will allow you to control your rtorrent instance from Telegram client.

Tested and working on Synology and QNAP, but should work on any x86_64 devices.

## Instructions
- Map any local port to 80 for rutorrent access (Default username/password is admin/admin)
- Map any local port to 443 for SSL rutorrent access if SSL_ENABLED=yes (Default username/password is admin/admin)
- Map any local port to 51415 for rtorrent
- Map any local port to 3000 for SSL flood access
- Map a local volume to /config (Stores configuration data, including rtorrent session directory. Consider this on SSD Disk)
- Map a local volume to /downloads (Stores downloaded torrents)

In order to change rutorrent web access password execute this inside container:
- `sh -c "echo -n 'admin:' > /config/nginx/.htpasswd"`
- `sh -c "libressl passwd -apr1 >> /config/nginx/.htpasswd"`

**IMPORTANT**
- In newer versions of flood it is needed to specify how is the connection to rtorrent established in the first user creation window. Specify "Unix Socket" type and "/run/php/.rtorrent.sock" in the rTorrent Socket field.
- Since v1.0.0 version, rtorrent.rc file has changed completely, so rename it before starting with the new image the first time. After first run, add the changes you need to this config file. It is on <YOUR_MAPPED_FOLDER>/rtorrent directory.
- Since v2.0.0 version, config.php of rutorrent has added new utilities, so rename it before starting with the new image the first time. After first run, add the changes you need to this config file. It is on <YOUR_MAPPED_FOLDER>/rutorrent/settings directory.

## User / Group Identifiers

When using volumes (`-v` flags) permissions issues can arise between the host OS and the container, we avoid this issue by allowing you to specify the user `PUID` and group `PGID`.

Ensure any volume directories on the host are owned by the same user you specify and any permissions issues will vanish like magic.

In this instance `PUID=1000` and `PGID=1000`, to find yours use `id user` as below:

```
  $ id username
    uid=1000(dockeruser) gid=1000(dockergroup) groups=1000(dockergroup)
```
